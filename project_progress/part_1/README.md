# Part 1: Text Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis

## 1. Data Preparation

The **Data Preparation** step is handled in the notebook **`DataPreparation.ipynb`**.

This notebook is responsible for preparing and cleaning the dataset before any analysis is performed.  
It can be executed directly **without any modifications** — all required configurations are already set up.

When you run this notebook, it will process the raw dataset located in the `data/` folder and generate a new, cleaned file in the same folder.  
This processed file will later be used as input for the EDA phase.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The **EDA** process is contained in the notebook **`EDA.ipynb`**.

This notebook includes both **code and visualizations** to explore and understand the statistical characteristics of the dataset — such as distributions, correlations, and general data patterns.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Before running the `EDA.ipynb` notebook, you must first execute the `DataPreparation.ipynb` notebook.  
> This ensures the cleaned dataset file required for the EDA is generated in the `data/` folder.
